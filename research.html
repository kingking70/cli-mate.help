            <ol>notes
                <li>[Singapore must diversify its energy supply by having more electricity imports and using low-carbon hydrogen for power generation, as part of nine recommended strategies laid out in the 56-page report] - what report? what strategies? have they been implemented?</li>
                <li>[committee – chaired by Mr Choi Shing Kwok, director and chief executive officer of the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute – noted that it was “not possible to craft a single definitive long-term strategy” given how complex the energy transition will be] - who is choi shing kwok? what is complex about an energy transition? </li>
                <li>[3 plausible scenarios: (1) clean energy renaissance - world collective action to develop energy and digital technologies rapidly, assumes strong global cooperation between countries, end with sg decarbonising smoothly & diversified supply mix by 2050; (2) climate action bloc - supportive geopolitical environment, favours global solutions, tech development especially energy related is slow, end with sg 2050's main supply be imported electricity while waiting for low carbon tech to mature; (3) emergent technology trailblazer - fragmented geopolitical but tech development accelerates closer to 2050, sg makes proactive investments in new tech to decarbonise & hydrogen as main energy supply] - i would need to rethink all 3 scenarios. my intuition is that hydrogen is as dangerous as nuclear, would need to fact check this again. in 2025, we're approaching something closer to a mix of (2) and (3) where ASEAN is trying to stick together while the western powers do their own thing.</li>
                <li>[While Singapore takes on a different decarbonisation journey in each scenario, the committee said it is evident that electricity imports, hydrogen, solar and energy storage systems will be important. New low-carbon supply alternatives and carbon markets may also play key roles. In tandem, efforts must be made to manage the growth of energy demand and shape user consumption to “provide a longer runway to deploy supply-side measures, while also lowering costs”. A “multi-layered grid” with digital technologies for security and efficiency will also be required amid the proliferation of distributed energy resources and other changes by then.] - basically, trying to figure out the most viable way to build a distributed and secure energy resource system. to me, it sounds like i should approach this problem first as an software engineer, restructuring the monolith to a modular system. what is singapore's current energy supply chain? the demand can be held off for now since pricing doesn't seem to be the current issue from this article alone.</li>
                <li>[Singapore will be starting its trials for electricity imports this year. To ensure supply security, the country will need to develop a diversified portfolio of import partnerships supported by a regional grid and trading platform, as well as cost-efficient back-up supply options.] - the 'trials for electricity imports' is a hyperlink but there's no link connected. how would trials work?</li>
                <li>[Singapore should develop “a national hydrogen strategy” and work with local and international stakeholders to develop a robust hydrogen supply chain, the report said. Solar is another potential supply, although that will require more innovative deployment options, the use of the latest solar photovoltaic technologies and more energy storage systems. Other strategies mooted include tapping carbon markets to address “residual and hard-to-abate carbon” and monitoring technology developments for new low-carbon supply alternatives, such as carbon capture, utilisation, and storage, geothermal and nuclear fusion technologies.] - what about the amount of land needed for energy utilisation? as far as i know, nuclear is the most efficient in terms of output and land usage.</li>

            <ol>notes
                <li>[the agreement will enable deeper nuclear cooperation and build on Singapore and US' strong bilateral partnership. The agreement is expected to come into force by end-2024 and will last for 30 years. This agreement will also enable Singapore to collaborate with other countries that use nuclear energy technologies and designs containing components or intellectual property of US origin. To date, the US has 24 active 123-Agreements including with China, India and Japan. Several ASEAN member states also have agreements with the US. Indonesia and Vietnam's respective deals with the US came into force in 1981 and 2014, while the Philippines' agreement with the US entered into force earlier this month on Jul 2] - several countries are in agreement to utilise nuclear. US as the main manufacturer of sorts for nuclear, i think this could be good for security if the politicians who matter make ethical decisions thoroughly.</li>
                <li>[123 Agreements provide a legal framework for peaceful nuclear cooperation such as the export of nuclear material, equipment, and components from the United States to another country, according to the US Department of State’s website. In addition, they facilitate cooperation in other areas, such as educational and technological transfers and collaborations between US and partner countries. Partners are held by a set of non-proliferation requirements to guarantee that the information obtained through this agreement will only be used for peaceful purposes. US Congress approval is needed for the deal, which will facilitate Singapore’s access to detailed information on US nuclear energy technologies and expertise that are under export control.] - same point as before</li>
                <li>[Singapore has not made any decision regarding the deployment of nuclear energy in the country] - why not? it is because we are afraid for security/safety reasons or we don't have enough knowledge?</li>
                <li>[22 report on Singapore’s energy future commissioned by the Energy Market Authority stated that nuclear energy could supply about a tenth of the country’s energy needs by 2050. In April, Second Minister for Trade and Industry Tan See Leng said that the country has plans to build a pool of about 100 nuclear energy experts in the medium to long run but stressed that no decision had been made on the deployment of nuclear energy. "We are committed to a decarbonisation journey, a process that will end by 2050, resulting in net zero emissions. So we will do everything that's possible to ensure that we achieve those targets but at the same time, we need to always ensure our own energy security, and also at the same time to make it cost effective for all of our fellow citizens," said Dr Tan, adding that all options were "on the table". "Clean nuclear energy is one possible option but let me be clear, we have not decided on whether we're going to eventually use nuclear energy or not." ] - why not? with nuclear, we could reach net zero emissions quicker than 2050.</li>
                <li>[US’ Foundational Infrastructure for the Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology (FIRST) program. Under the FIRST programme, Singapore will gain access to the network of US entities involved in civilian nuclear energy, including the US National Laboratories and companies developing newer nuclear energy technologies, to facilitate our capability-building process. FIRST will also serve as a platform to coordinate US-Singapore civil nuclear cooperation, the factsheet said.] - still exploring? this article was in 2024</li>

                <li>[Authorities had considered the possibility of using nuclear power in 2010, but assessed that conventional nuclear technologies were not suitable for Singapore.] - why not suitable for Singapore?</li>
                <li>[However, there have been "significant advancements" in nuclear technologies since, with the development of SMRs which have better safety features than conventional reactors, added Mr Wong. He pointed out that regardless of whether Singapore looks to electricity, hydrogen or nuclear energy, it will need to make "major investments" in new infrastructure. As such, there will be a S$5 billion top up to the Future Energy Fund, he announced. "This will further support our critical undertaking to secure clean power for Singapore," added Mr Wong. He had announced the setting up of the fund with an initial injection of S$5 billion at last year's Budget. Said Mr Wong: "Our efforts to enhance our technology and innovation engines, strengthen our enterprise ecosystem, invest in new infrastructure and overcome our resource constraints, will enable us to refresh our value proposition and stay ahead in a rapidly changing world."] - what advancements are there? why can't nuclear be used in singapore? is it public sentiment, their lack of education on nuclear? why do we need $5 billion top up to the Future Energy Fund? I assumed nuclear would be cheaper to purchase but expensive to procure, since it's efficient, i'd imagine the overall cost as an energy supply to be the lowest. Is the cost mainly building its structure to house nuclear and ensure safety for its waste? What is the Future Energy Fund?</li>

            <ol>notes
                <li>[Advanced SMR (small module reactor) technologies are at a "tipping point for becoming commercially viable" and it makes sense for Singapore to consider them afresh, said Mr Nick Ash, Southeast Asia energy business leader at Arup.] - who is nick ash? what is arup?</li>
                <li>[“With its limited land availability and geological conditions, Singapore is unlikely to be able to dispose of nuclear waste within its borders. Therefore, collaboration with countries that already have plans for long-term waste disposal will be vital,” said Mr Ash.Currently working with the Singapore government to explore pathways and technologies that will support its energy transition plans, Mr Ash explained that compact reactors will produce a smaller volume of waste compared to traditional nuclear units. Singapore could thus work with “potential partners” like the UK, US, France, Canada and South Korea to properly dispose of nuclear waste.] - dig into arup</li>
                <li>[But unless a nuclear waste deal is struck with another country, or it becomes possible to harness energy from nuclear fusion, questions remain, said National University of Singapore associate professor of political science Chong Ja Ian. “No country is currently taking another country’s nuclear waste,” said Assoc Prof Chong. “A nuclear power plant is likely to begin producing waste in 20 to 30 years. That is not a long time.”] - why not nuclear fission? what solutions are there for nuclear waste? if it crosses border, how can i create something within the space of my country? like a small rubbish bin for small module reactor? why is it a different story from rad future? she asserts that the waste can be properly managed, dry cask?? and nothing can damage it.</li>
                <li>[here are two different waste management solutions Singapore can explore, according to Mr Alvin Chew, senior fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), who said waste management is both a “technical and political issue”. The first would be to store nuclear waste in a storage pool, known as a spent fuel pool. The waste will be stored there for about five to 15 years before it gets sent to other countries for its plutonium to be extracted. The remaining waste after the plutonium is extracted will be placed in a dry cask, which would have to be stored underground for security reasons. The second solution, said Mr Chew, would be to drill a 500m to 2km deep hole and place the waste inside before sealing it up. When asked if Singapore has space for either of these solutions, Mr Chew said it “is not a problem”.] - the article further says the space is an issue only if public do not want to stay near a plant, the education and comparison with current industries are paramount, i don't think people understands the urgency here. with nuclear energy harvested safely, we reach net zero even faster, decrease climate change, increase every aspect of our lives. <b>i guess it comes down to storytelling for the public. perhaps this is cli-mate.help direction now. to tell nuclear's story. </b></li>

                <li>[SNRSI's expanded research scope is part of Singapore's efforts to strengthen its capabilities to better understand and assess nuclear technologies and safety. Its core research includes reactor safety, how radioactive materials can spread in the environment, the impact of radiation on living organisms and nuclear policy.] - singapore is worried of the consequences of a bad accident, the research aims to predict its probability but shouldn't prevention and solutions be researched instead</li>
                <li>[Originally conceived in 2014 as the Singapore Nuclear Research and Safety Initiative, it is now a full-fledged institute. It also aims to double its current pool of 50 experts by 2030.] - can i join by 2030, either as a scientist or something else, i'd prefer reading and making decisions, as of today 24 aug 2025, instead of being in a lab the whole day</li>
                <li>[With the new building, the institute plans to build its capabilities in the areas of simulation and perform physical experiments on reactor safety. It also has plans to develop new methods for the rapid detection of radioactive substances, and to study the possible adaptive effects on living organisms exposed to low dosages of radiation, among other goals.] - what about prevention and solutions? already built!!</li>
                <li>[The new premises will also host educational activities for members of the public to "dispel common misconceptions and provide a deeper understanding of radiation". "This includes sharing information on the various applications of ionising radiation areas such as medicine, industry, and even agriculture,"] - great news, i'll join when i'm better!!!</li>

                <li>[Mr Rafael Grossi, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said that t is every country’s sovereign right to decide to go for a nuclear programme. But those that are keen to do so must abide by stringent nuclear safety and security rules, he said. “A country that wants a nuclear programme must be a party to the Convention on Nuclear Safety. It must be a party to the IAEA (and) must submit itself to peer reviews and monitoring,” he said. The IAEA Convention on Nuclear Safety requires parties that operate land-based civil nuclear power plants to submit reports for “peer review”, according to the IAEA’s website. “It is a system that has an interlocking network of regulatory, mutual checks with the IAEA in coordination. So this gives countries the certainty that... you know what your neighbour is doing,”] </li>

                <li>[But given the rising energy demand, and the need to reduce emissions from the power sector, Singapore needs a stable domestic source of energy, he added. “When it comes to decarbonising, what are your options? Here, there is no hydropower. You have renewables, but you don’t have much territory... It’s a small country, so you cannot have wind parks for kilometres on end. “In my opinion... Singapore could rightly (be) the most perfect example of a country that needs nuclear energy. With a very small nuclear power plant, you can have a level of energy density and production that you cannot match with anything else,” he said. He added that Singapore has the technological capacity, financial ability and regulatory institutions in place to deploy nuclear energy if it so decides.] - i agree, how do i act on this? how do i actively improve on singapore's nuclear plant adoption</li>
                <li>[(singapore's) government agencies contribute to several technical committees within the IAEA and have benefited from the organisation’s expertise in nuclear medicine, imaging and oncology. These included both workshops and longer-term programmes, covering topics such as nuclear medicine, nuclear law, food safety and pest control. Under the renewed agreement, Singapore will develop training programmes for countries in areas such as human health, industrial radiography and environmental radioactivity monitoring.] - how can i be a part of this?

When we read, brain networks involved in deciphering — or imagining — another person's motives, and the areas involved in guessing what will happen next are activated, Neeley says. Imagining what drives other people — which feeds into our predictions — helps us see a situation from different perspectives Stories can alter broader attitudes as well, Green says — like our views on relationships, politics or the environment. Messages that feel like commands — even good advice coming from a friend — aren't always received well. If you feel like you're being pushed into a corner, you're more likely to push back. But if someone tells you a story about the time they, too, had to end a painful relationship, for example, the information will likely come across less like a lecture and more like a personal truth. Solid information in any form is good, Green says. "But that's not necessarily enough." A vivid, emotional story "can give that extra push to make it feel more real or more important." If you look at the times somebody's beliefs have been changed, she says, it's often because of a story that "hits them in the heart."] <b>could games provide the same activation in the brain? i could dim down the game elements and tell an emotional story visually, and in certain junctures, including game elements to engage the audience... my games should be personalised so the audience, regardless of their background, can correlate and act upon my desired result - which is to let the singapore government say yes to nuclear energy development. i'm thinking aloud here. wouldn't it be easier to convince 1 person to many? i just need to convince the prime minister instead of the public... but public education is important as well. that needs to be fixed, that is what holding the prime minister back on saying yes since he may lose votes from the public. there's no incentive for him yet to say yes.</b>
